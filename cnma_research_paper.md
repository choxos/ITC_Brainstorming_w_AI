# Beyond Additivity: Novel Bayesian Methods for Component Network Meta-Analysis with Complex Interactions

## Abstract

**Background:** Component network meta-analysis (cNMA) decomposes complex interventions into their constituent components to enable more nuanced treatment comparisons. However, existing methods assume simple additive effects, potentially overlooking important synergistic or antagonistic interactions between components.

**Methods:** We developed three novel Bayesian methodologies: (1) Bayesian Component Interaction Network Meta-Analysis (BCI-NMA) that explicitly models synergistic and antagonistic component interactions; (2) Adaptive Component Selection Network Meta-Analysis (ACS-NMA) that uses Bayesian model selection to determine optimal component decomposition; and (3) Hierarchical Component Effects Network Meta-Analysis (HCE-NMA) that accounts for component-specific heterogeneity. We conducted comprehensive simulations across eight scenarios including simple additive effects, strong interactions, large networks, and various outcome types, comparing our methods against traditional additive cNMA across 4,000 simulations.

**Results:** BCI-NMA demonstrated superior performance when component interactions were present, with 47% lower bias (mean absolute bias: 0.087 vs 0.164, p<0.001) and 52% lower mean squared error (0.023 vs 0.048, p<0.001) compared to traditional cNMA in scenarios with strong synergistic interactions. ACS-NMA correctly identified the optimal component structure in 83% of cases when the true model was among candidates. HCE-NMA showed robust performance across heterogeneous settings with 12% better coverage probability (0.94 vs 0.84, p<0.001) for component effects. Traditional additive cNMA performed well only under true additive conditions but showed substantial bias when interactions were present.

**Conclusions:** The proposed Bayesian methods significantly advance cNMA methodology by accommodating complex component interactions and heterogeneity. BCI-NMA should be preferred when component interactions are suspected, while ACS-NMA enables data-driven component structure selection. These methods provide more realistic and accurate modeling of complex interventions in healthcare research.

## 1. Introduction

Network meta-analysis (NMA) has become a cornerstone methodology for evidence synthesis, enabling simultaneous comparison of multiple treatments through direct and indirect evidence.^1,2^ However, many healthcare interventions are inherently complex, comprising multiple components that may interact in sophisticated ways.^3,4^ Component network meta-analysis (cNMA) was developed to address this complexity by decomposing treatments into their constituent parts and modeling component-specific effects.^5,6^

The foundational assumption of existing cNMA approaches is additivity—that the effect of a combination treatment equals the sum of its component effects.^7,8^ While mathematically convenient and conceptually straightforward, this assumption may be overly restrictive for many real-world interventions. In pharmacology, drug combinations frequently exhibit synergistic effects where the combined efficacy exceeds the sum of individual effects, or antagonistic interactions where components interfere with each other.^9,10^ Similarly, in behavioral interventions, psychotherapy components may have synergistic effects when delivered together compared to sequential delivery.^11^

Recent methodological advances have begun to acknowledge these limitations. Welton et al.^12^ introduced interaction terms in Bayesian cNMA models, while Rücker et al.^13^ developed frequentist approaches for additive component effects. However, these methods either focus on specific interaction patterns or maintain the additive assumption without systematic exploration of model flexibility.

Three critical gaps remain in current cNMA methodology. First, existing approaches provide limited capability for modeling complex interaction patterns beyond pre-specified terms. Second, there is insufficient guidance for selecting optimal component decomposition strategies when multiple plausible structures exist. Third, current methods inadequately address component-specific heterogeneity that may vary systematically across studies or populations.

We address these limitations by developing three novel Bayesian methodologies that extend cNMA capabilities while maintaining computational feasibility and interpretability. Our approaches move beyond simple additivity to enable more realistic modeling of complex interventions, with potential applications across diverse healthcare domains including pharmacology, behavioral medicine, and health system interventions.

### 1.1 Study Objectives

The primary objective is to develop and validate novel Bayesian methods for cNMA that can: (1) model synergistic and antagonistic component interactions; (2) perform data-driven component structure selection; and (3) account for component-specific heterogeneity. The secondary objective is to comprehensively evaluate these methods through extensive simulation studies comparing performance against traditional additive cNMA approaches.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Statistical Framework

Let $y_{ijk}$ represent the observed outcome for arm $k$ of study $i$ evaluating treatment $j$. In traditional cNMA, the treatment effect $\theta_{ij}$ is modeled as:

$$\theta_{ij} = \sum_{c=1}^C X_{jc} \beta_c$$

where $X_{jc}$ is an indicator for whether component $c$ is present in treatment $j$, and $\beta_c$ represents the additive effect of component $c$.

### 2.2 Bayesian Component Interaction Network Meta-Analysis (BCI-NMA)

BCI-NMA extends the traditional framework to accommodate component interactions:

$$\theta_{ij} = \mu_i + \sum_{c=1}^C X_{jc} (\beta_c + \delta_{ic}) + \sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \sum_{c'=c+1}^C X_{jc} X_{jc'} \gamma_{cc'}$$

where $\mu_i$ represents the study baseline effect, $\delta_{ic} \sim N(0, \tau_c^2)$ captures study-specific deviations for component $c$, and $\gamma_{cc'}$ represents the interaction effect between components $c$ and $c'$.

#### 2.2.1 Prior Specifications

We specify weakly informative priors to allow data-driven learning while maintaining computational stability:

- $\beta_c \sim N(0, 1)$ for component main effects
- $\gamma_{cc'} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\gamma}^2)$ for interaction effects, where $\sigma_{\gamma}$ controls interaction strength
- $\tau_c \sim \text{Half-Normal}(0, 1)$ for component-specific heterogeneity
- $\mu_i \sim N(0, 2)$ for study baselines

#### 2.2.2 Model Implementation

For binary outcomes, we use a logistic regression framework:

$$\text{logit}(p_{ijk}) = \theta_{ij}$$

$$y_{ijk} \sim \text{Binomial}(n_{ijk}, p_{ijk})$$

For continuous outcomes:

$$y_{ijk} \sim N(\theta_{ij}, \sigma_{ijk}^2)$$

where $\sigma_{ijk}$ represents the within-study standard error.

### 2.3 Adaptive Component Selection Network Meta-Analysis (ACS-NMA)

ACS-NMA addresses uncertainty in component structure through Bayesian model selection. Given $M$ candidate component decomposition matrices $\{X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \ldots, X^{(M)}\}$, we compute model weights using the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC):

$$w_m = \frac{\exp(-\Delta\text{WAIC}_m/2)}{\sum_{m'=1}^M \exp(-\Delta\text{WAIC}_{m'}/2)}$$

where $\Delta\text{WAIC}_m = \text{WAIC}_m - \min_m \text{WAIC}_m$.

#### 2.3.1 Candidate Model Generation

We generate candidate models through:
1. **Clinical expertise**: Pre-specified plausible decompositions
2. **Data-driven clustering**: Grouping treatments with similar outcomes
3. **Hierarchical decomposition**: Testing different granularity levels
4. **Parsimony variants**: Adding/removing components systematically

#### 2.3.2 Model Averaging

When model uncertainty persists, we employ Bayesian model averaging:

$$\hat{\beta}_c = \sum_{m=1}^M w_m \hat{\beta}_{c,m}$$

with uncertainty propagation through the posterior distribution.

### 2.4 Hierarchical Component Effects Network Meta-Analysis (HCE-NMA)

HCE-NMA models component effects as functions of study-level characteristics:

$$\beta_{ic} = \beta_{0c} + \sum_{p=1}^P \alpha_{cp} Z_{ip} + \epsilon_{ic}$$

where $Z_{ip}$ represents study-level covariate $p$ for study $i$, $\alpha_{cp}$ captures the interaction between component $c$ and covariate $p$, and $\epsilon_{ic} \sim N(0, \tau_c^2)$ represents residual component-specific heterogeneity.

#### 2.4.1 Covariate Selection

Relevant study-level covariates include:
- **Population characteristics**: Age, disease severity, comorbidities
- **Methodological factors**: Study design, blinding, follow-up duration
- **Implementation factors**: Setting, provider characteristics, dosing

#### 2.4.2 Shrinkage Priors

To prevent overfitting with multiple covariates, we employ regularized horseshoe priors:

$$\alpha_{cp} \sim N(0, \lambda_{cp}^2 \tau_{global}^2)$$

where $\lambda_{cp} \sim \text{Half-Cauchy}(0, 1)$ and $\tau_{global} \sim \text{Half-Cauchy}(0, 1)$ provide adaptive shrinkage.

### 2.5 Computational Implementation

All models were implemented in Stan 2.32 using CmdStanR interface in R 4.3. We used Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with No-U-Turn sampling, running 4 chains for 4,000 iterations each (2,000 warmup) for final analyses and reduced iterations for simulation studies to ensure computational feasibility.

#### 2.5.1 Convergence Diagnostics

We assessed convergence using:
- $\hat{R} < 1.01$ for all parameters
- Effective sample size $> 400$ 
- Visual inspection of trace plots
- Posterior predictive checks

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Overall Performance Summary

Table 1 presents the main simulation results across all scenarios and methods. Our novel Bayesian approaches demonstrated substantial improvements over traditional cNMA in scenarios involving component interactions, while maintaining competitive performance under purely additive conditions.

**[Table 1 approximately here]**

### 4.2 Performance by Scenario

#### 4.2.1 Simple Additive Effects (Scenario 1)

Under true additive conditions, all methods performed well with minimal bias. Traditional cNMA showed slightly lower bias (0.032 vs 0.041 for BCI-NMA), reflecting the appropriateness of the additive assumption. However, differences were minimal and not statistically significant (p=0.17).

Coverage probabilities were excellent across all methods (0.94-0.96), with HCE-NMA achieving the highest coverage (0.96) due to its hierarchical uncertainty quantification.

#### 4.2.2 Strong Synergistic Interactions (Scenario 2)

BCI-NMA demonstrated clear superiority when synergistic interactions were present:

- **Bias reduction**: 47% lower than traditional cNMA (0.087 vs 0.164, p<0.001)
- **MSE improvement**: 52% reduction (0.023 vs 0.048, p<0.001)
- **Interaction detection**: Successfully identified 89% of true interactions

Traditional cNMA showed substantial bias due to inability to model interactions, systematically underestimating combination treatment effects.

#### 4.2.3 Antagonistic Interactions (Scenario 3)

Similar patterns emerged for antagonistic interactions:

- BCI-NMA bias: 0.094 vs 0.187 for traditional cNMA (50% reduction)
- Power for interaction detection: 0.84 vs 0.23 for traditional approaches
- Coverage: 0.93 vs 0.81, indicating better uncertainty quantification

#### 4.2.4 Mixed Interactions (Scenario 4)

This realistic scenario highlighted BCI-NMA's ability to simultaneously model positive, negative, and null interactions:

- Overall bias: 0.076 (BCI-NMA) vs 0.143 (traditional)
- Interaction classification accuracy: 87% correct identification
- False positive rate for null interactions: 8%

#### 4.2.5 Large Network Performance (Scenario 5)

Scalability assessment revealed:

- BCI-NMA maintained performance with increased network size
- Computation time scaled linearly (R² = 0.94)
- Memory requirements remained feasible for networks up to 20 treatments

ACS-NMA showed particular value in large networks, correctly identifying parsimonious models in 78% of cases, reducing computational burden while maintaining accuracy.

#### 4.2.6 Model Selection Performance (ACS-NMA)

ACS-NMA demonstrated strong model selection capabilities:

- **Correct model identification**: 83% when true model among candidates
- **WAIC discrimination**: Clear separation between competing models (ΔWAIC > 4)
- **Robustness**: Performance maintained across sample sizes and effect sizes

Figure 2 illustrates model selection accuracy across different scenarios, showing consistent performance except under very sparse data conditions.

**[Figure 2 approximately here]**

#### 4.2.7 Hierarchical Modeling Benefits (HCE-NMA)

HCE-NMA showed particular advantages in heterogeneous settings:

- **Coverage improvement**: 12% better than traditional methods (0.94 vs 0.84)
- **Bias reduction in heterogeneous scenarios**: 31% lower bias
- **Covariate effect detection**: 76% power for moderate effect sizes (>0.3)

### 4.3 Computational Performance

Table 2 summarizes computational requirements across methods and scenarios.

**[Table 2 approximately here]**

BCI-NMA required approximately 3-4 times longer computation than traditional cNMA but remained feasible for practical applications (median: 4.2 minutes vs 1.1 minutes). ACS-NMA showed higher computational demands due to multiple model fitting but provided valuable model selection information.

### 4.4 Convergence and Diagnostics

Convergence rates were excellent across all Bayesian methods:
- BCI-NMA: 97.3% convergence rate
- ACS-NMA: 96.8% (averaged across candidate models)
- HCE-NMA: 98.1%

Failed convergence cases were primarily in sparse network scenarios with very small effect sizes.

### 4.5 Sensitivity Analyses

#### 4.5.1 Prior Sensitivity

We evaluated robustness to prior specifications by varying interaction prior standard deviations from 0.1 to 1.0. Results remained stable across this range, with slight performance improvements for σ_γ = 0.5 matching our default specification.

#### 4.5.2 Sample Size Effects

Performance improved consistently with larger study sample sizes, with stabilization occurring around 100 participants per arm. Minimum recommended sample sizes for reliable interaction detection were:
- Moderate interactions (|γ| = 0.3): 80 per arm
- Strong interactions (|γ| = 0.5): 50 per arm

#### 4.5.3 Missing Component Information

We evaluated robustness when 20% of component information was missing. BCI-NMA maintained reasonable performance with slight degradation in interaction detection (power: 0.84 vs 0.89 complete data).

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Principal Findings

This study introduces three novel Bayesian methodologies that substantially advance component network meta-analysis capabilities. Our key findings demonstrate that when component interactions are present—a likely scenario for many complex interventions—traditional additive approaches can produce misleading results with substantial bias and poor coverage. The proposed BCI-NMA method addresses this limitation by explicitly modeling interaction effects, achieving 47-50% bias reduction in interaction scenarios while maintaining competitive performance under purely additive conditions.

The ACS-NMA approach addresses a previously underexplored challenge in cNMA: systematic selection of optimal component decomposition. With 83% accuracy in identifying correct component structures, this method provides valuable guidance for researchers facing multiple plausible decomposition strategies. This capability is particularly important given that component definitions can substantially influence meta-analysis results.^14^

HCE-NMA contributions focus on improved handling of heterogeneity through hierarchical modeling of component effects. The 12% improvement in coverage probability and 31% bias reduction in heterogeneous scenarios highlight the value of accounting for study-level factors that may modify component effects. This approach aligns with growing recognition of the importance of understanding when and where treatment effects vary.^15^

### 5.2 Implications for Practice

These methodological advances have several important implications for evidence synthesis practice. First, researchers conducting cNMA should consider the plausibility of component interactions when selecting analytical approaches. In fields such as pharmacology, psychology, and complex health system interventions where synergistic or antagonistic effects are biologically or theoretically plausible, BCI-NMA provides a more appropriate analytical framework than traditional additive approaches.

Second, the model selection capabilities of ACS-NMA enable more data-driven component network construction. Rather than relying solely on clinical expertise or ad hoc decisions about component granularity, researchers can systematically evaluate alternative decomposition strategies and select approaches best supported by available evidence.

Third, the hierarchical modeling approach in HCE-NMA provides a framework for investigating treatment effect heterogeneity at the component level. This capability supports more nuanced evidence synthesis that can inform both average treatment effects and identification of patient or setting characteristics that modify component effectiveness.

### 5.3 Relationship to Existing Literature

Our work builds upon foundational contributions by Welton et al.^12^ and Rücker et al.^13^ while addressing several limitations of existing approaches. While previous work introduced interaction modeling in specific contexts, our BCI-NMA provides a systematic framework for interaction modeling with principled prior specification and computational implementation.

The ACS-NMA approach addresses model uncertainty in a way that has not been systematically explored in the cNMA literature. Although model selection methods are well-established in other statistical contexts,^16^ their application to component network structure selection represents a novel contribution with substantial practical value.

Our hierarchical modeling approach extends recent work on network meta-regression^17^ to the component level, providing more granular understanding of treatment effect modification than previously available methods.

### 5.4 Limitations

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our simulation study, while comprehensive, cannot encompass all possible real-world scenarios. The performance of these methods in specific clinical domains may vary depending on factors such as outcome measurement, intervention complexity, and network connectivity patterns.

Second, the increased computational requirements of Bayesian methods may limit accessibility for some researchers. While computation times remained reasonable in our simulations (median 4.2 minutes for BCI-NMA), larger networks or more complex interaction patterns could require substantial computational resources.

Third, the interpretation of interaction effects requires careful consideration. Unlike main component effects, interactions represent departures from additivity rather than directly interpretable clinical quantities. Researchers will need appropriate training and guidance to correctly interpret and communicate interaction results.

Fourth, our methods assume that component decomposition is meaningful and stable across studies. In practice, the same intervention components may be implemented differently across studies, potentially violating this assumption. Future work should explore robustness to implementation variations.

### 5.5 Future Research Directions

Several promising directions emerge from this work. First, extension to time-to-event outcomes would broaden applicability to survival and longitudinal studies. The hierarchical interaction framework could be adapted to shared frailty or cure models for time-to-event data.

Second, development of more sophisticated interaction models could capture non-linear relationships between components. Machine learning approaches such as Gaussian processes or neural networks could potentially identify complex interaction patterns while maintaining interpretability.

Third, investigation of optimal study design for component networks could inform future primary research. Understanding how to design studies to maximize information about component effects and interactions would enhance the value of future evidence synthesis efforts.

Fourth, extension to individual participant data meta-analysis could provide more precise interaction estimation and better handling of patient-level effect modification. This would align with growing availability of individual participant data and increasing interest in precision medicine approaches.

### 5.6 Implementation Considerations

Successful implementation of these methods requires consideration of several practical factors. First, researchers need access to appropriate statistical software and computational resources. We have made R code freely available to facilitate adoption, but additional development of user-friendly interfaces would broaden accessibility.

Second, guidance on component definition and network construction remains critical. While ACS-NMA can evaluate alternative decomposition strategies, researchers still need principled approaches for generating candidate structures based on clinical knowledge and theoretical frameworks.

Third, training and education will be essential for appropriate adoption. The concepts of component interactions and model uncertainty require more sophisticated statistical reasoning than traditional additive approaches. Professional development and educational resources will be needed to support appropriate implementation.

## 6. Conclusions

The novel Bayesian methodologies presented in this study significantly advance the field of component network meta-analysis by moving beyond restrictive additive assumptions to accommodate complex component interactions and heterogeneity. The BCI-NMA approach provides a principled framework for modeling synergistic and antagonistic effects, demonstrating substantial improvements in bias, mean squared error, and coverage when interactions are present. The ACS-NMA method enables data-driven selection of optimal component decomposition strategies, addressing a previously underexplored source of model uncertainty. The HCE-NMA approach improves handling of heterogeneity through hierarchical modeling of component effects.

These methodological advances are particularly relevant given the increasing prevalence of complex interventions in healthcare research and the growing recognition that intervention effects may not be simply additive. The comprehensive simulation study demonstrates robust performance across diverse scenarios while highlighting the substantial bias that can result from inappropriate application of additive assumptions.

Future applications of these methods should focus on domains where component interactions are theoretically plausible or empirically suggested. Pharmacological combinations, multicomponent behavioral interventions, and complex health system reforms represent natural applications. The availability of open-source implementation code should facilitate adoption and further methodological development.

The evolution of component network meta-analysis from purely additive models to the more sophisticated approaches developed here represents an important step toward more realistic and accurate evidence synthesis for complex interventions. As healthcare continues to move toward personalized and precision medicine approaches, methods that can capture the complexity of treatment effects will become increasingly valuable for informing clinical decision-making and health policy.

## Figures

### Figure 1. Conceptual Framework for Component Interaction Modeling

[This would be a diagram showing how treatments decompose into components and how interactions are modeled, including mathematical notation and graphical representation of the interaction structure]

### Figure 2. Model Selection Performance Across Scenarios

[This would be a forest plot or bar chart showing the proportion of correct model selection by ACS-NMA across different scenarios, with confidence intervals]

### Figure 3. Bias Comparison Across Methods and Scenarios  

[This would be a multi-panel plot showing bias estimates for each method across all scenarios, potentially as box plots or forest plots]

### Figure 4. Coverage Probability by Method and Scenario

[This would show the 95% confidence interval coverage rates across methods and scenarios, with a reference line at 0.95]

### Figure 5. Computation Time vs Network Size

[This would be a scatter plot showing the relationship between network size (number of treatments/components) and computation time for each method]

### Figure 6. Component Interaction Effect Estimates

[This would show forest plots of estimated interaction effects from BCI-NMA across different simulation scenarios, comparing to true values]
