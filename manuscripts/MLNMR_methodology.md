## Title
Adaptive and Robust Bayesian Multilevel Network Meta‑Regression: Extensions for Integration, Uncertainty, and Measurement Error

## Abstract
Multilevel Network Meta‑Regression (ML‑NMR) calibrates conditional individual‑level models to aggregate‑level data via integration, enabling population‑specific marginal contrasts. We introduce four Bayesian extensions—Adaptive Bayesian ML‑NMR (AB‑MLNMR), Hierarchical Effect‑Modifier ML‑NMR (HEM‑MLNMR), Bayesian Model Averaging ML‑NMR (BMA‑MLNMR), and Robust ML‑NMR (R‑MLNMR)—to address structural uncertainty, partial pooling of effect modification, model misspecification, and covariate measurement error. We formalize likelihoods for binary/continuous/survival outcomes, detail analytical and numerical integration schemes, and provide diagnostics and sensitivity analyses.

## 1. Background
ML‑NMR generalizes NMA by combining IPD and AgD through a shared individual‑level outcome model and an aggregate‑level likelihood obtained by integrating over covariate distributions. It reduces aggregation bias and admits transportable estimands. Challenges persist regarding integration accuracy, effect‑modifier sharing, and propagation of uncertainty.

## 2. Model
For study s, treatment k, and covariates \( \mathbf{x} \), specify
\[ g(\theta_{sk}(\mathbf{x})) = \mu_s + \boldsymbol{\beta}_1^\top \mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{2,k}^\top \mathbf{x}^{EM} + \gamma_k \mathbb{I}(k\neq A). \]
Aggregate likelihoods arise from
\[ \theta_{\cdot k}^{(s)} = \int g^{-1}\big(\mu_s + \boldsymbol{\beta}_1^\top \mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\beta}_{2,k}^\top \mathbf{x}^{EM} + \gamma_k\big) f_s(\mathbf{x})\, d\mathbf{x}. \]
Binary outcomes require Poisson‑binomial approximations or two‑parameter binomial approximations when heterogeneity of individual probabilities is nontrivial.

## 3. Extensions
### AB‑MLNMR
Hierarchical priors on \( \boldsymbol{\beta}_{2,k} \) with shrinkage across treatments to adaptively determine shared vs treatment‑specific modification.

### HEM‑MLNMR
Partial pooling of effect‑modifier slopes across treatments/classes with hyperpriors that reflect biological relatedness.

### BMA‑MLNMR
Model averaging over link functions, interaction structures, and integration schemes with WAIC/LOO weights and posterior stacking.

### R‑MLNMR
Measurement error models for covariates and heavy‑tailed likelihoods to mitigate misspecification and extrapolation.

## 4. Computation and Diagnostics
Stan implementations support QMC/MC integration for AgD, WAIC/LOO for selection, and posterior predictive checks. Convergence diagnostics (\(\hat R\), ESS, divergences) and sensitivity to covariate summaries are mandatory.
