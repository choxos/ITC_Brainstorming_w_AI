## Title
Bayesian MAIC: Hierarchical Weights, Network Consistency, Multi‑Target Calibration, and Robustness to Overlap and Missingness

## Abstract
Matching‑Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) reweights IPD to match AgD covariate distributions. We provide a Bayesian reformulation with hierarchical priors on weight parameters (BH‑MAIC), network consistency constraints (N‑MAIC), multi‑target calibration (MT‑MAIC), and robustification (R‑MAIC) via trimming and entropy‑like priors, missing‑data models, and sensitivity analyses. This corrects deterministic weighting, propagates uncertainty, and scales to networks.

## Methods
Weights are parameterized on the log‑scale with priors that control dispersion and overlap. Network constraints enforce \( d_{AC}=d_{AB}+d_{BC} \) coherency. Multi‑target calibration shares information across targets via hierarchical priors. We derive likelihoods under GLM links and show how to compute anchored vs unanchored estimands consistently on the linear predictor scale.
