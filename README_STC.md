# Advanced Bayesian Methods for Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC)

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of four novel Bayesian methodologies for Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) that address critical limitations identified in David Phillippo's seminal PhD thesis (2019). These methods significantly advance population-adjusted indirect comparisons for health technology assessment.

## Background

Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) is a population adjustment method used when individual patient data (IPD) are available from one study and aggregate data (AgD) from another. However, current STC implementations suffer from fundamental limitations:

1. **Scale Dependence**: Conflicts between outcome modeling scale and indirect comparison scale
2. **Simulation Bias**: Unnecessary variation introduced by treating predictions as random samples
3. **Network Limitations**: Inability to handle multi-treatment networks
4. **Robustness Issues**: Poor handling of measurement error, missing data, and model misspecification
5. **Deterministic Uncertainty**: Failure to properly propagate prediction uncertainty

## Novel Methodologies

### 1. Bayesian Hierarchical STC (BH-STC)

**Purpose**: Addresses scale dependence and uncertainty propagation issues

**Key Features**:
- Scale-consistent indirect comparison formation
- Full Bayesian uncertainty propagation
- Hierarchical modeling for population heterogeneity
- Proper handling of all uncertainty sources

**When to Use**: Binary, count, or survival outcomes with non-identity link functions

### 2. Network STC (N-STC)

**Purpose**: Extends STC to multi-treatment networks

**Key Features**:
- Network consistency constraints
- Mixed IPD/AgD evidence integration
- Coherent indirect comparison estimation
- Scalable to large treatment networks

**When to Use**: Networks with 3+ treatments requiring STC-based outcome modeling

### 3. Robust STC (R-STC)

**Purpose**: Provides robustness to data quality issues

**Key Features**:
- Measurement error correction for covariates
- Multiple imputation for missing data
- Model averaging for specification uncertainty
- Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounders

**When to Use**: Poor data quality, missing data, measurement error concerns

### 4. Adaptive STC (A-STC)

**Purpose**: Handles complex covariate structures adaptively

**Key Features**:
- Machine learning enhanced covariate modeling
- Gaussian process for non-linear relationships
- Bayesian variable selection
- Ensemble methods for model uncertainty

**When to Use**: High-dimensional covariates, uncertain model specification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stan Compilation Errors**:
   ```r
   # Ensure cmdstanr is properly installed
   cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
   
   # Check Stan installation
   cmdstanr::cmdstan_version()
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Reduce `n_chains` or `n_iter`
   - Use fewer parallel cores
   - Process scenarios sequentially

3. **Convergence Problems**:
   - Increase `n_warmup` and `n_iter`
   - Adjust `adapt_delta` to 0.99
   - Check data for extreme values

4. **Long Runtime**:
   - Start with `n_simulations = 50` for testing
   - Use fewer scenarios initially
   - Optimize parallel processing setup

### Performance Optimization

```r
# Optimal settings for different scenarios
# Quick testing:
bhstc(..., n_chains = 2, n_iter = 1000, n_warmup = 500)

# Production analysis:
bhstc(..., n_chains = 4, n_iter = 4000, n_warmup = 2000)

# High-accuracy research:
bhstc(..., n_chains = 4, n_iter = 8000, n_warmup = 4000)
```

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Convergence Diagnostics

All methods automatically check:
- **R̂ statistic** < 1.01 for all parameters
- **Effective sample size** > 400 (bulk), > 100 (tail)
- **Divergent transitions** < 1% of samples
- **Energy diagnostics** for HMC performance

### Model Validation

```r
# Check model diagnostics
result$diagnostics

# Posterior predictive checks
bayesplot::ppc_dens_overlay(
  y = ipd_data$outcome,
  yrep = posterior_predict(result$fit)
)

# WAIC for model comparison
result$fit$loo()
```
